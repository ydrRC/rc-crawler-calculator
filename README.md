## üìä Usage

### Basic Calculation
1. **Enter Gear Specifications**:
   - Pinion gear tooth count (8-30 teeth)
   - Spur gear tooth count (20-100 teeth)

2. **Select Components**:
   - Choose your transmission from the dropdown
   - Select front axle configuration
   - Select rear axle configuration

3. **Optional Speed Calculation**:
   - Enter motor KV rating
   - Set maximum battery voltage
   - Specify tire size (inches or mm)

4. **View Results**:
   - Motor gear ratio
   - Final front and rear drive ratios
   - Theoretical top speeds (if motor specs provided)

### Advanced Features

#### Reverse Transmission
Check the "Reverse Transmission Ratio" option to swap front and rear transmission outputs. This is useful for certain transmission configurations.

#### Tire Size Units
Toggle between inches and millimeters for tire diameter input. Common sizes:
- **Scale Options**: Various tooth count combinations for fine-tuning

## üéØ Use Cases

### Competition Setup
- **Rock Racing**: Lower ratios (20-40:1) for speed
- **Scale Crawling**: Higher ratios (60-100:1) for torque and control
- **Trail Running**: Balanced ratios (40-60:1) for versatility

### Motor Recommendations
- **Brushed Motors**: 1200-2200 KV typically
- **Brushless Motors**: 1400-3500 KV range
- **High Torque**: Lower KV (800-1500) for technical crawling

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Adding New Components

#### New Transmission
Edit `js/data.js` and add to the `TRANSMISSIONS` object:
```javascript
"New Transmission Name": { front: 2.500, rear: 3.000 }
```

#### New Axle
Add to the `AXLES` object:
```javascript
"New Axle Name": 4.125
```

### Data Sources
All gear ratios are sourced from:
- Manufacturer specifications
- Community measurements
- RC crawler forums and databases

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Calculation Formulas

**Motor Gear Ratio**:
```
Motor Ratio = Spur Teeth √∑ Pinion Teeth
```

**Final Drive Ratio**:
```
Final Ratio = Motor Ratio √ó Transmission Ratio √ó Axle Ratio
```

**Theoretical Speed (MPH)**:
```
Speed = (Motor RPM √∑ Final Ratio) √ó Tire Circumference √ó 60 √∑ 63,360
Where: Motor RPM = Motor KV √ó Battery Voltage
```
